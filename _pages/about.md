# About MapNet

MapNet is a group of New Zealand-based molecular and quantitative geneticists 
from organisations involved in research related to genomics. It was started in 2005 to 
ensure cross-sector interactions.

The primary role of MapNet is to ‘encourage pre-commercial, cross-sector, 
gene mapping related R&D in a range of organisms valuable to NZ's economy, 
ecology and culture’.  Participation in MapNet is voluntary, and at an 
individual researcher level. 

Organisations represented include Universities (Auckland, Canterbury, Massey, 
Otago, Unitec, Victoria), Crown Research Institutes (AgResearch, Environmental 
Science and Research, Manaaki Wehenua - Landcare Research, NIWA, Plant & Food 
Research, Scion) and private entities (AbacusBio, The Elshire Group, Livestock 
Improvement Corporation). They encompass New Zealand’s health, primary production, 
and environment genetics sectors. 

MapNet aims to coordinate scientists from different 
organisations using common technologies and analytical platforms, to foster the 
development of multidisciplinary and cross-sector research projects, and to facilitate 
knowledge exchange between researchers.
